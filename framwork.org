#+title: Framwork

Okay basically I want to make the file loading better and add mouse commands and human interaction steps. I think it might be best to develope a compiler.

mode 1: dummy CLI mode, just like it is now, accepts basic syntax for quick shit.

mode 2: actual good imports a file and runs commands.

name space: xdotool key commands would go straight through, add call let repeat sleep type mousemove mousbutton import

compile process.
1. load file.
2. make a big array from the file, splitton on semi colons
3. scan through it looking for import commands.
idk tbh, this seesms like a loss
